PESEL as a service
====

This is a simple project that aims at wrapping one of my libraries with simple HTTP API (REST-ish).

The library used is [PESEL](https://github.com/MaciekTalaska/pesel) which aims at validating and generating PESEL numbers. Please find more info on the project page.

The purpose of this project is to use actix-web for wrapping library with a HTTP API.
